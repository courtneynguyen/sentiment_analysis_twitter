@elonmusk Well Elon‚Äî I am new to twitter because of you. I even paid my $8‚Äì because I appreciate your acquisition
I would think because Musk‚Äôs acquisition of Twitter had ZERO good intent, making the purchase could be construed as tool to willfully squelch the FREE SPEECH of millions of regular citizens &amp; activists. 
But such would have to be proven in a court of law.

@HalifaxEditor @Sultanofmonog IMO it's meta. Twitter usage is at an all time high largely due to people discussing his acquisition. As people continue to complain about Twitter on this platform, and targeting Elon specifically--they are increasing its value.
@elonmusk I disliked twitter prior to your acquisition. It‚Äôs much more enjoyable now. Cleaning up spam bots and constant messages from scammers would rock AND be well worth the $8.
@FLMarkM @elonmusk @TeslaAIBot 10s, if not 100s, of billions of $$$ in $TSLA value has evaporated as a direct result of Elon‚Äôs Twitter acquisition shenanigans over the last few months. I love the guy, and I‚Äôm highly optimistic that $TSLA value will get back on track. Until then, like many, I‚Äôm not thrilled.
Race to Zero Followers.
Ever since Elon's acquisition of Twitter, I have been hemorrhaging followers. And I'm ok with it. My opinions are not for the feeble. Neither is cold hard logic. When Love, Peace , and happiness are my only message I don't expect everyone to be on board.
Parallels between Putin‚Äôs war in Ukraine and Musk acquisition of Twitter. They came as conquerors against unknown responses. They underestimated the environment they were getting in. They are micromanaging and they need to get their hands off immediately or nothing will be left.

Quite often when visiting via web its:

Controversial person I dont follow

OPINION: While some people may be concerned about Elon Musk‚Äôs acquisition of Twitter, it is clearly the best step in implementing freedom of speech on Twitter. Read the article by @harrymurphy1776: https://t.co/R1jIWlOkp7
@GoodnessNwanebu @sama I think it‚Äôs the freedom from government censorship and harassment.

My concern with Elon is that leading up to his acquisition, he expressed a belief that twitter should conform to that definition. Afterwards he‚Äôs entirely changed his position without addressing it.
Now looking back at the messages from the Twitter-acquisition lawsuit, Elon made the most unintentionally forward-looking move by not taking money from SBF &amp; FTX and going with CZ &amp; Binance instead. He even hit SBF with a ‚Äúnew phone, who dis?‚Äù text. https://t.co/DNZmj5spTF

@Michail_Shapiro @bessbell What about Elon's behavior exhibited thus far since his acquisition of Twitter has shown he has good business acumen?  He seems like an emotionally stunted manchild - the last person on earth to run a major platform.  Also, he's not rags-to-riches first gen wealth.
I love how Elon Musk does Twitter business on Twitter. The very platform he trash talked for months leading to his acquisition.

I am not kidding, since the acquisition of Twitter I seriously get spam DMs more that ever before...
A month ago it was one every other week, now it's every single day
It's odd. Since #Twitter acquisition I've noticed an increased number of group chat request. All spam, bot or fakes. Reported every single one but they keep coming. Am I the only one?
Forget a head of lettuce, somebody needs to start tracking how much money the Twitter acquisition lost Musk. He's already blown a ton of Tesla stock value and advertisers are really uncertain about sticking around, start the counter and wait for the FTC and private lawsuits.
@mtaibbi This just reflects the obvious similarities of both characters. For people who knew who Musk is it was apparent before, and with Twitter acquisition and subsequent mess it has only become apparent for more people.
I am happy to share that this is my first tweet post-acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk. Getting in those Linkedin vibes on Twitter because I lack big achievements announcements. #late20ssucks
@StarrySeaWitch Musk fans all seem to be class traitors who fantasize about being him one day. They ignore the fact that he is the product of the inheritance of massive wealth. He‚Äôs not smart. The way in which he has botched this twitter acquisition is glaring proof for those who want to see it.

@anon_syx @RetroBayCafe @JimAlger @OctoSquidVR @elonmusk Was Twitter losing 4m per day before the acquisition? Or is it a result of the financing of the deal combined with lost advertising due to advertisers lack of confidence in Elons plans for Twitter?

@HerelnTheDark Given the $ involved, Twitter won't just die on the vine. Despite difficulties w/monetization, the platform is still worth billions &amp; holds a lot of sway in the media landscape.

Hello, @ElonMusk.

What does it take for a paid (non-profit) customer of @Twitter to receive "customer service"?

I would assume that after acquisition, customer service would be a top priority.

Or, is saying how great @Twitter is now you bought it the only way to get attention?
@AlexColinGG @TheWorthyHouse Correct. Besides, Twitter doesn't need accounting profits.
All it needs is cash flow to keep things going.
Recouping the cost of the acquisition is the main goal. So you aim for a perceived turnaround, polish up the books and go public again.
Musk &amp; advisors know this quite well.
@elonmusk is Tony Stark, within this reality - and despite mainstream condemnation - it only further proves, that his acquisition of Twitter, is in a sense, providing the majority of North America (not just the US) with hope against globalist initiatives.

THE FIRST POSSIBILITY IS THAT NOTHING MUCH CHANGES. EVEN THOUGH ELON MUSK IS NOW IN CHARGE OF TWITTER,

@fau1in @troyhouse @DoctorJack16 Then he can‚Äôt bring a company public and not care about the stock price. The same bloated stock price paid for his over priced acquisition of Twitter. Stock price matters, and he MUST care. He has a fiduciary responsibility as the CEO.

The acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk is a triple threat. He shouldn't be solely responsible for the wrong company at the wrong time. Elon Musk strategically multitask as part of his work ethic. He uses batching, a productivity trick, to combine multiple task whenever possible.
@shxkcnaksmc @crusa_tv @AlanSig3800 @rebecca_fachner That's where we disagree. He may be a savvy business man who accumulated several successes, but he is not an infallible genius. His Twitter acquisition has demonstrated numerous shortcomings and glaring mistakes. Peter principle: he rised to his level of incompetence.
@unusual_whales Makes no sense. In fact, the media stopped making sense on Twitter‚Äôs acquisition from the very first day. I guess you can do that when there‚Äôs no actual information available. You can say whatever you want. But whatever.
@alexbruesewitz @elonmusk Your dates are incorrect. The investigation into animal rights violations began well prior to the twitter acquisition. That said if animals are going to used as research vessels then neuralink would be the project I‚Äôd approve.

The discussions have so far centered around replacing the $3 billion of unsecured debt on which Twitter pays an interest rate of 11.75%, the maximum banks had agreed to finance the acquisition in April.

@KeithOlbermann @JohnWDean @elonmusk Only options I can see are either nationalization of Twitter via the consent decree or a crowdsourced acquisition and conversion into nonprofit. The former seems unlikely but I'm in for $1,000 of crowdsourcing, from gains on selling all my Twitter stock after Elon juiced it.
@ThisIsKyleR 2 reasons; many of us ditched Twitter in the face of being ltd. until learning of  th promise of a Musk acquisition and I'd bet many bots were removed by the previous crew to hide that they suppressed as many users as they had. Like flushing drugs when the cops are at the door.
